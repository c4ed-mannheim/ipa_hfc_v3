{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckcomment} creates an output sheet of all comments made using the SurveyCTO {it:comment} feature. 
Since these are downloaded as separate media files per observation, this command compiles all comments into
an excel sheet "12. comments".

{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckcomment} is one of the checks run in IPA's high frequency checks. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into an .xlsm file 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the Data Management System.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
In IPA's master_check.do file created when using the Data Management System, the inputs you enter into
hfc_inputs.xlsm are used as globals through {cmd:ipacheckimport} to fill in this command:
{p_end}{cmd}{...}

    enumerator(${enum})
    submit(${date})
