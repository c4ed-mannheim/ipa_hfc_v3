{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipachecktextaudit} creates an output sheet that merges all media files created when using the SurveyCTO
{it:text audit} features. Since these are downloaded as separate media files per observation, 
this command compiles all text audits by question and by group (if specified) into
an excel sheet "13. text audit". Note that this command requires an excel input sheet with at least one 
column, "group_name", where all groups to be summarized should be listed. IPA's Data Management System input 
sheet also includes "exclude_variable" (can be empty) and "keep" (for keepvars option).

{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipachecktextaudit} is one of the checks run in IPA's high frequency checks. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into an .xlsm file 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the Data Management System.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
In IPA's master_check.do file created when using the Data Management System, the inputs you enter into
hfc_inputs.xlsm are used as globals through {cmd:ipacheckimport} to fill in this command:
