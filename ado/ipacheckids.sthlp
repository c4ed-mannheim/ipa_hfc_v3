{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckids} checks for duplicates of the ID variable specified. If duplicates are found, an export will be 
made with two sheets. "Diffs" will show each duplicate group and uses {help:cfout} to compare all variables between the 
duplicates. If there are more than two observations with the same ID variable, each will be compared with the first observation
submitted. "Raw" shows each duplicate group with all variables that have different values across the same ID variable to 
help reconcile duplicates.

{pstd}
The {it:force} option uses {help duplicates drop} in order to randomly drop all observations in a duplicate group except one. 
This allows the workflow to continue, since IPA's Data Management System cannot run with duplicates.

{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckids} is one of the checks run in IPA's high frequency checks. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into an .xlsm file 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the Data Management System.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
In IPA's master_check.do file created when using the Data Management System, the inputs you enter into
hfc_inputs.xlsm are used as globals through {cmd:ipacheckimport} to fill in this command:
{p_end}{cmd}{...}
{phang2}.  ipacheckids ${id} using "${dupfile}",
  enum(${enum})
