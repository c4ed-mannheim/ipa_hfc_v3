{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipatrackversions} exports a table of versions used by submission date and, if applicable, 
a list of all observations that are using a form beside the most recent form version available by 
submission date. This table includes the starttime and endtime variable to provide information on when 
the survey was conducted in comparison with a new form version.

{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipatrackversions} is one of the checks run in IPA's high frequency checks. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into an .xlsm file 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the Data Management System.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
In IPA's master_check.do file created when using the Data Management System, the inputs you enter into
hfc_inputs.xlsm are used as globals through {cmd:ipacheckimport} to fill in this command:
{p_end}{cmd}{...}
{phang2}.  ipatrackversions ${formversion}, 
  id(${id})
  enumerator(${enum})
  submit(${date})
