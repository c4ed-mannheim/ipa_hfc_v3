{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckdates} This program checks for common issues with date variables, 
including: survey start and end dates are unmissing, survey start and end dates are equal, 
survey start dates are not before start of data collection, survey start dates are not 
after the current date, and survey start dates within the same geographic cluster are 
within X days of each other. 

{pstd}
Note that {help varlist} requires the variables that indicate starttime and endtime,
usually the SurveyCTO-generated {it:starttime} and {it:endtime} variables. These variables must be in %tc, %tC, or %td format. 


{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckdates} is one of the checks run in IPA's high frequency checks. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into an .xlsm file 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the Data Management System.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
In IPA's master_check.do file created when using the Data Management System, the inputs you enter into
hfc_inputs.xlsm are used as globals through {cmd:ipacheckimport} to fill in this command:
{p_end}{cmd}{...}
