{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckdups} checks for duplicates of variables that should be unique, such as GPS points and other household indicators for enumerator monitoring. 
Note this check should not be used for the ID variable when runnning within IPA's Data Management System, since
other checks in the Data Management System require a unique ID variable. {help ipacheckids} is used to summarize duplicates
and differences between interviews with the same value for the ID variable.

{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckdups} is one of the checks run in IPA's high frequency checks. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into an .xlsm file 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the Data Management System.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
In IPA's master_check.do file created when using the Data Management System, the inputs you enter into
hfc_inputs.xlsm are used as globals through {cmd:ipacheckimport} to fill in this command:
{p_end}{cmd}{...}
{phang2}.  ipacheckdups ${variable2}, 
    id(${id}) 
    enumerator(${enum}) 
    submit(${date}) 
    keepvars(${keep2}) 
    saving("${outfile}") 
    sctodb("${server}") 
    sheetreplace ${nolabel}
