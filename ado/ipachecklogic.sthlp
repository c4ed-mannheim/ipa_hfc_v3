{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipachecklogic} confirms skip patterns and logical constraints within a survey using the {help assert} 
command. While it is not necessary to include patterns that are already included in the survey programming, 
{cmd:ipachecklogic} can be used to check indirect skip patterns and other constraints that are not directly
programmed. 

{pstd}
Note that assertions and conditions will be parsed together; the first assertion will be matched 
with the first condition listed in the -condition- option, the second assertion will be matched with the second 
condition listed in the -condition- option, separated by ";", and so on.

{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipachecklogic} is one of the checks run in IPA's high frequency checks. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into an .xlsm file 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the Data Management System.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
In IPA's master_check.do file created when using the Data Management System, the inputs you enter into
hfc_inputs.xlsm are used as globals through {cmd:ipacheckimport} to fill in this command:
{p_end}{cmd}{...}

{phang2}
.      ipachecklogic ${variable6},
    assert(${assert6})
    condition(${if_condition6})
    id(${id})
    enumerator(${enum})
    submit(${date})
    keepvars(${keep6})
    saving("${outfile}")
    sctodb("${server}")
