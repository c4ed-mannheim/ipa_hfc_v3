{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckconstraints} checks that certain numeric variables fall within reasonable 
hard and soft constraints. Most numeric questions that are asked during an interview 
have a logical range of possible values. Entries that exceed these limits could be a 
sign of misentry or fraud. Note that values entered in -smin- and -smax- are applied 
to the order of the variables specified. The first variable's minimum and maximum acceptable
value will be the first value in -smin- and the first value in -smax-, respectively. 



{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckconstraints} is one of the checks run in IPA's high frequency checks. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into an .xlsm file 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the Data Management System.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
In IPA's master_check.do file created when using the Data Management System, the inputs you enter into
hfc_inputs.xlsm are used as globals through {cmd:ipacheckimport} to fill in this command:
