{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckfollowup} compares values of identifying variables from a master tracking list to data
in memory to confirm reliability of question and enumerator performance. Variables with different 
values across the two datasets will be exported to the output sheet. Note that variables must have
the same name across the master dataset and dataset in memory to be compared.  

{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckfollowup} is one of the checks run in IPA's high frequency checks. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into an .xlsm file 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the Data Management System.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
In IPA's master_check.do file created when using the Data Management System, the inputs you enter into
hfc_inputs.xlsm are used as globals through {cmd:ipacheckimport} to fill in this command:
{p_end}{cmd}{...}
