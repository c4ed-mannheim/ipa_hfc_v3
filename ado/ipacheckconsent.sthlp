{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckconsent} exports the ID, enumerator, and any other variables specified
when consent is not given, or the consent variable(s) specified does not equal the consent value(s) specified. 
This check is meant to more quickly identify surveys where consent was not given.

{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckconsent} is one of the checks run in IPA's high frequency checks. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into an .xlsm file 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the Data Management System.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
In IPA's master_check.do file created when using the Data Management System, the inputs you enter into
hfc_inputs.xlsm are used as globals through {cmd:ipacheckimport} to fill in this command:
{p_end}{cmd}{...}
{phang2}.  ipacheckconsent ${variable3},
    consentvalue(${consent_value3})
    id(${id})
    enumerator(${enum})
    submit(${date})
    keepvars(${keep3})
    saving("${outfile}")
    sctodb("${server}") 
    sheetreplace ${nolabel}
