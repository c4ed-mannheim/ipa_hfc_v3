{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckenum} creates an Excel workbook with 7 sheets: 

{phang2}.  "summary": summary of average interviews, missing, don't know, refuse, other, and duration by enumerator in total and number of days specified in {it:days} option{p_end}
{phang2}.  "missing": average of missing values by enumerator for {it:missvars} variables{p_end}
{phang2}.  "dontknow": average of "don't know" values by enumerator for {it:dkrfvars} variables{p_end}
{phang2}.  "refusal": average of "refuse" values by enumerator for {it:dkrfvars} variables{p_end}
{phang2}.  "other": average of "other" values by enumerator for {it:othervars} variables{p_end}
{phang2}.  "duration": average of duration by enumerator for {it:durvars} variables{p_end}
{phang2}.  "stats": statistics by enumerator for {it:statvars} variables{p_end}

{pstd}
Note that this command recognizes "refuse" as ".r", "missing" as ".", "other" as ".o", and "don't know" as ".d".

{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckenum} is one of the checks run in IPA's high frequency checks. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into an .xlsm file 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the Data Management System.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
In IPA's master_check.do file created when using the Data Management System, the inputs you enter into
hfc_inputs.xlsm are used as globals through {cmd:ipacheckimport} to fill in this command:
{p_end}{cmd}{...}
{phang2}.    ipacheckenum ${enum} using "${enumdb}",
     dkrfvars(${dkrf_variable14})
     missvars(${missing_variable14})
     durvars(${duration_variable14})
     othervars(${other_variable14})
     statvars(${stats_variable14})
