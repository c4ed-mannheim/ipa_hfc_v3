{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckresearch} creates a workbook of oneway and twoway tabulations of specified variables.
Since this was created to be inputted through IPA's Data Management System input sheet, it requires specific inputs
for the {it:variables} option to work separately. Each variable must have a specific variable type: {p_end}
{phang2}.  "contn": continuous, normal (mean) {p_end}
{phang2}.  "conts" continuous, skewed (mean) {p_end}
{phang2}.  "cat" categorical, Chi-squared{p_end}
{phang2}.  "cate" categorical, Fisher's exact test {p_end}
{phang2}.  "bin" binary, Chi-squared {p_end}
{phang2}.  "bine" binary, Fisher's exact test{p_end}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckresearch} {it:variables} option should follow this pattern: var1 vartype1 / var2 vartype2 / ...

{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckresearch} is one of the checks run in IPA's high frequency checks. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into an .xlsm file 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the Data Management System.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
In IPA's master_check.do file created when using the Data Management System, the inputs you enter into
hfc_inputs.xlsm are used as globals through {cmd:ipacheckimport} to fill in this command:
{p_end}{cmd}{...}

{phang2}.    ipacheckresearch using "${researchdb}",
    variables(${variablestr15}) // oneway
	
{phang2}.    ipacheckresearch using "${researchdb}",
    variables(${variablestr16}) by(${by16}) // twoway
